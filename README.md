Project Title: NLP Ham or Spam Classifier using Naive Bayes
Description: Employing Natural Language Processing, the project utilizes a Naive Bayes Classifier to predict and categorize YouTube comments as 'Ham' or 'Spam,' enhancing comment moderation with data-driven efficiency.
Key Steps:
Data Loading
Initial Exploration
Data Preparation (Stop words removal, Lowercase conversion, Lemmatization, Isalpha filtering)
Counter Vectorization
Downscale transformed data using tf-idf
Shuffle the dataset
Split the dataset into training and testing
Fit training data into a Naive Bayes classifier
Cross-validate the model on the training data using 5-fold
Test the model on the test data
